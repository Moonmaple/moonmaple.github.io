<p class=MsoNormal>Interest in IT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I never realised that I had an interest in IT.  While I was
growing up in the 1980’s, my father ran a successful software services
company.  This meant that we always had computers in the house, and he would
sit in front of a DOS screen for hours.  As far as I was aware, every house had
this!  Loading games via 25 floppy disks just to fly an x-wing fighter in 16
VGA colour was normal, right? When I got to school in the mid 80’s, I didn’t
understand why there was only one computer for the whole school.  And who was
Carmen Santiago? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time I left school, my computer skills meant that my
first job in 1997 was a 1<sup>st</sup> Level Helpdesk Support role.  It was
during this work experience that I realised, not everyone had the computer
skills that I had.  Not everyone grew up with computer parts lying around the
house that you could build a computer from. I worked in desktop, software and
printer support for about 11 years (going between coordination, hardware
management and small business support).  But I never “loved” the work.  I was
just using the skills that I had developed naturally in my home environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But then I discovered Data Administration and Management. 
It wasn’t the same installation and support process day in and day out like IT
support.  I was making sure that business data was accurate, working and able to
be used for analysis.  Being able to make data “clean” and usable really made
me feel like I had achieved something. I discovered that what made me really
excited was a clean process, a clean data set and valid insights from the usage
of that data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ve come to RMIT through Open Universities.  RMIT has a
great reputation locally here in Melbourne.  When I enrolled in the first unit,
I discovered my Dad had studied at RMIT 30 years ago! How did I not know this?
This is my second unit through RMIT.  I am hoping to do down the path of Data
Analytics.  I want to work with big data sets and use predictive modelling to
produce interesting insights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The kind of job that I would love to do would a Senior Data
Analyst. Working with an NGO or Not For Profit would be an extra sweetener.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Working in a role that would require the understanding of
requirements of a project or business plan and formulating a way to produce
analytical models to support them would be incredibly rewarding.  Getting into
the detail of the data and producing insights, trends and understanding how
they all fit together would also tick my process nerd boxes.  But getting
different data sets and sources to link together would be the best part of a
job as a Senior Data Analyst.  Sharing this excitement about data and
business/project process flow and how to produce data analysis to direct the
plan while mentoring Junior Data Analysts would also be part of my ideal role.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The kind of skills and qualifications that would be required
to be successful in this type of role would be a collection of technical and collaboration
skills.  First, a degree in IT, Maths or Statistics.  Then a Senior Data
Analyst would also need an ability to theorise and build data modelling
processes.  In order to produce these models, a Senior Data Analyst would need
to know how to get different data sets from different sources to combine into
something that can be analysed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most importantly, a Senior Data Analyst would be able to
understanding business/project requirements, develop working relationships with
the teams/people that provide details about the requirements and be able to
manage a team to produce what the business/project is expecting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My aim is to first get a Degree in IT.  I would like to
major in Data Analytics and include some kind of statistical analysis.  Machine
learning and algorithm development is something I want to get my head around.
Once I have completed my degree, I am going to build on my current business
Data Skills.  Hopefully dive into a big data set, get cosy with the details of
how the data has been produced and managed and work hard at building my
modelling and analysis experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Personal Profile</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m pretty hesitant about online personality and aptitude
tests.  It’s very hard to determine how someone learns or listens when it is
only being done via an online interface.  Especially if they are free!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But personality testing is big business!  A lot of job
interview processes that I have been through required the Myers Briggs test. 
There are all kinds of articles about why this test is not all that relevant. 
The mother and daughter who developed it were not trained psychologists, the
results put people’s personality into binary categorisations and it doesn’t
allow for the fluidity and complexity of people and their experiences. The Jung
theories it is based on, were even questioned by Jung! Every time I do the
Myers Briggs, I get a different result.  I am introverted, until I am really
excited.  But I always get an introverted score.  Is that because I reason
things out myself before sound boarding it on someone? Who knows? But I really
feel that Myers Briggs is an overblown, over rated, ridiculous way of finding
out about someone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An interesting opinion on Myers Briggs; <a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Would I take personality tests into account when forming a
team? Nope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If someone was really excited about personality tests, would
I take that into account when assessing their relevance to a team? I sure
would!  It would be a solid no from me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An ISTJ are apparently punctual, introspective, step-by-step
type people.  They are “at home with the facts” and use procedures that have
evidence that it works.  They don’t deal well with inconsistency and can make
tough calls and stick to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Project Idea</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have recently been involved in an experience with local
council. I have a Beagle.  Beagles like to bark. A lot. They also like to
howl.  We have worked very hard on training our dog to not bark all the time. 
We had direct reaction and redirection to her every time she barked.  We
created obstacles throughout the yard so that she could not get to the parts of
the boundary where she liked to bark.  We introduced a citronella collar that
would spray her every time she barked.  It was a long process, but by the time
she was 18 months to 2 years old, our efforts paid off.  We now have a dog that
still barks, but not consistently and not causing any affect to our
neighbours.  She is pretty well behaved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, a neighbour got a new dog.  That barks.  All day,
all night.  So much so we feel terrible for them.  Every now and then, our dog
responds to the neighbours dog barking.  Other neighbours have reported this
neighbour to the council.  One of the responses from the barking dog neighbour
to the council was that our dog provoked their dog into barking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I knew this was not the case.  But how on earth could I
prove it?  I would start to video when the neighbours dog was barking (which
there was ample opportunity), and there would be my dog in the video, doing her
thing, but not barking.  However, the arbritary nature of when I did and didn’t
video, did not lend any credibility to my argument that it was not my dog. So,
we were asked by the council to provide a “diary” of the barking.  Both ours
and the neighbours dog.  So every time my dog barked or the neighbours dog
barked, I had to note it in the diary.  Council uses these diaries to see if
they “match” with another neighbour that was also keeping a diary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This approach to data collection was obviously not going to
be consistent or accurate.  People aren’t home all the time, people can fill
out the diary when they feel like it.  Or they can falsify the information they
were noting in the diary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if there was a way for council to know that the barking
was being tracked correctly and how often a dog barks?  What if they could know
if the information was being collected consistently?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How about a collar that collects the data!  It knows when a
dog is barking and it notes the time, the date and how much barking there was. 
It notes the time, date and length that the bark collar was turned on and on a
dog because it can recognise temperature and therefore know that it is on a dog’s
neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> This data can be collected and used by the dog owner and
provided to council.  No more hand diaries, no more she said, he said, and they
can issue nuisance dog fines, or dismiss neighbours allegations with accurate
data!  This could also be used for dog training.  We never knew how much our
dog was barking when we were not home.  This app would tell you the problem
times so that you can customise your training.  It could also be integrated
with a citronella collar which can let the dog know that there is a negative
action every time they bark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There would need to be a collar that was fitted out with a
temp sensor, a bark sensor (there are currently collars on the market that
already have this) and there would need to be a Bluetooth antenna in the collar
and someway in the collar to store the data.  Then there would be an app to transfer
the data to and collate and report. The collar would sync with Bluetooth like a
fit bit and transfer the data.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone with software skills would need to write the data
collection app.  This app will have a report output function to provide to
council or the owner.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The collar would be custom made, so someone with hardware
knowledge is going to be required. The collar would contain things like:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Battery</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Waterproof Contacts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>USB Charger port</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bluetooth Antenna</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Temp Sensor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Motherboard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Microcontroller</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memory</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fitbits and Watches already have most of this hardware built
into them. (I fix it pulled one apart so you can see what is in it: <a
href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Fitbit+Flex+Teardown/16050">https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Fitbit+Flex+Teardown/16050</a>)
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it is entirely possible to build something like this, but
someone with a high degree of hardware knowledge would be required.  Someone
with electrical engineering experience.  Or, someone who might be able to use
an existing hardware technology and customise to our needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having a collar that knows how long it has been on a dog,
when the dog barked and how often would mean that objective data can be
provided to determine the level of nuisance without wondering if people are
filling out data correctly.  </p>
